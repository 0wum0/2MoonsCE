- Fixed `RelicsPage` lang loading: reads JSON directly via `dirForId()` instead of relying on PluginManager cache — by 0wum0
- Fixed `Cronjob::execute()`: wraps `require_once` + `run()` in single `try/catch` so lock is always released on error — by 0wum0

- Fixed `PluginManager::registerCronjob()`: auto-inserts DB row if missing (idempotent) — by 0wum0
- Fixed `activate()`: bootstraps `plugin.php` so `registerCronjob()` creates DB row; `deactivate()` disables only that plugin's cronjobs — by 0wum0

- Fixed `migration_14`: removed `PREPARE` blocks, use simple `ALTER TABLE` (try/catch handles duplicates) — by 0wum0

- Fixed `PluginManager::selectSingle()`: "Trying to access array offset on false" when `$res` is `false` and a `$field` is specified — added `is_array()` guard — by 0wum0
- Fixed Admin mobile navigation: `sidebar-overlay` div lacked CSS definition and was rendered `display:block` by external CSS override — added `style="display:none"` inline on element; JS now controls `display` directly via `overlay.style.display` instead of CSS class toggling — by 0wum0
- Fixed Admin mobile sidebar: `backdrop-filter:blur()` on `position:fixed` `.admin-sidebar` and `.admin-topbar` created stacking contexts that blocked pointer events on content behind them — removed `backdrop-filter` from both elements — by 0wum0
- Fixed Admin mobile breakpoint: raised from `768px` to `1100px` so sidebar hides correctly on tablets and larger mobile devices — by 0wum0
- Fixed Admin sidebar z-index: raised sidebar to `z-index:1001` (overlay `1000`) so nav links are clickable when sidebar is open — by 0wum0
